## 📘 Introduction
This project is part of my **Data Science module** for the *Statistics and Trends* assignment.  
The main objective is to explore how **global temperatures** have changed over time and understand the trend of **global warming** using **data analysis and visualization**.

The dataset contains **monthly and yearly temperature anomalies** of the globe.  
Through this project, I applied **data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis** techniques to demonstrate my learning and understanding.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preparation
The following steps were performed to prepare the dataset:

1. **Converted numeric columns** into float type for consistency.  
2. **Removed empty or irrelevant columns** that were not needed for analysis.  
3. **Replaced missing values** using the *forward fill* technique.  
4. Ensured the final dataset was clean, organized, and ready for visualization.

---

## 📊 Visualizations
I created **three main types of plots** to understand the data better:

### 1️⃣ Relational Plot — *Line Plot*
- Shows how the **temperature anomaly** changes over time.  
- Displays a **rising trend**, indicating **increasing global temperatures**.

### 2️⃣ Categorical Plot — *Bar Chart*
- Compares **monthly temperature anomalies**.  
- Shows that variations occur in all months, not just specific seasons.

### 3️⃣ Statistical Plot — *Correlation Heatmap*
- Reveals the **relationship** between monthly and yearly anomalies.  
- Indicates a **strong positive correlation**, meaning both follow similar patterns.

---

## 📈 Statistical Moments
To further analyze the data, I calculated the **four main statistical moments** on the “Monthly Anomaly” column:

- **Mean** → Average temperature anomaly.  
- **Variance** → Spread of temperature anomalies around the mean.  
- **Skewness** → Direction of the distribution (right/left).  
- **Kurtosis** → Sharpness or flatness of the distribution.

These measures helped in understanding how the data is distributed and how global temperatures are changing.

---

## 💬 Discussion
- The **global temperature anomalies** show a **clear upward trend**.  
- The **bar chart** confirms that this pattern is consistent across all months.  
- The **heatmap** shows that different anomaly measures are **closely related** and consistent.

---

## 🧭 Conclusion
This project used **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to clean, visualize, and analyze the dataset.  
I successfully created three plots — *line*, *bar*, and *heatmap* — and calculated the four **statistical moments**.

This analysis demonstrates how **data science** can be used to explore **real-world trends**, such as **climate change**, and highlights my early learning progress as a **Master’s student in Data Science**.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Areebgul/ADS1-stats-trends-assignment
```

### 2. Navigate to the project folder

```bash
cd ADS1-stats-trends-assignment
```

### 3. Install the required dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the analysis script

Execute the main analysis file located in the `code/` folder:

```bash
python code/stats_trends.ipynb
```

### 5. View the output

The generated visualizations and report will appear in the following folders:

- **plots/** → contains visualizations like `line_plot.png`, `bar_chart.png`, and `heatmap.png`
- **report/** → contains the final PDF report `Global_Temperature_Report.pdf`

### 6. Explore the dataset

If you want to open and explore the dataset yourself:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open or create a notebook to inspect the data interactively.

## 📊 Discussion

Based on the findings, the global temperature anomalies show a clear upward trend over time.  
The bar chart confirms similar patterns across all months, while the heatmap reveals consistency among anomaly measurements.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

In this project, Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib were applied to clean and analyze a real-world dataset.  
Three types of plots (line, bar, heatmap) and four main statistical moments were calculated.  
The project demonstrates how data science can uncover real-world patterns, such as evidence of climate change.
